For the robot to function we had to use code.

## Our Coding App

* We decided to use Pybricks Beta as our coding app. 
* It uses the programming language Python and even comes with its documentary.

## Our Coding Language

We used Python as our programming language. Here are some reasons why.

* One reason why we chose Python is because it is very precise. It's useful when having to do something at just the right distance.
* Another reason is that Python is a standard programming language.
  It is used all around the world, and many engineering jobs and robotics jobs require Python coding.
* And finally it has reusable functions. It is useful when having to repeat a task multiple times.

## Documenting

We spent a lot of time cleaning up and documenting our code so our fellow team members would know how the code worked.
  * We would put a comment describing what 5-6 lines did, and how it completed the mission.
