Hi, I am Ryan from team Robotmakers and my teammates are Aidan, Antoni, Ariana, and Anika. 

My team and I had an interview with Adaptive Sports for our innovation project. For our innovation project, we are trying to help
disabled skiers ski more efficient, safer and have a more enjoyable experience.

We learned that Adaptive Sports personalize solutions for different kinds of disabilities. They focus their designs to ensure 
that people with disabilities have as close an experience skiing like they don't have a disablity. For people in 
wheelchairs, if someone can't stand they use mono skis and if they have lower upper body strength, they use bi skis. 
If they have trouble balancing they use four tracker skis. 

For people that have poor eyesight they had several design ideas. For example they use a bell as a signal to turn. Another example is  
using a headset to communicate with a skier to help guide them to turn/slow down to avoid obstacles or slow down if going to fast. 
Finaly, part of the Adaptive Sports design was to use tethers on the side of slopes so the disabled/blind skier can't go off course.

Overall we learned a lot about their designs/design process. It was very inspiring to learn how they customized their designs to be as close
as possible to the experience without a disability even though the designs somtimes took several years to complete.
