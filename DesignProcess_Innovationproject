Hi, I am Ryan from team Robotmakers and my teammates are Aidan, Antoni, Ariana, and Anika. 

My team and I had an interview with Adaptive Sports for our innovation project. For our innovation project, we are trying
to help disabled skiers ski more efficiently, safer and have a more enjoyable experience.
