Hi, I am Ryan from team Robotmakers and my teammates are Aidan, Antoni, Ariana, and Anika. 

My team and I had an interview with Adaptive Sports for our innovation project. For our innovation 
project, we are trying to help disabled skiers ski more efficiently, safer and have a more enjoyable 
experience. 

We learned that Adaptive Sports personalize solutions for different kinds of people in wheelchairs. For 
example, if someone can't stand they use mono skis. Also, if they have trouble balancing they use four 
tracker skis
