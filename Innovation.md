Innovation is one of the six Core Values of FLL, and we have got an awesome opportunity to research about and design solutions for this season's Innovation Project. This project challenges us to use technology to enable more people to enjoy rewarding hobbies. We have decided to focus on **helping disabled people ski** with efficiency and safety.

## Outreach to Disabled Sports Innovators

We wanted to learn from the best, so we have contacted 6 different disabled sports organizations across the US, which are:

* [Adaptive Sports Center, Colorado](https://www.adaptivesports.org/) 
* [Adaptive Sports Connection, Ohio](https://adaptivesportsconnection.org/)
* [American Blind Skiing Foundation (ABSF)](https://www.absf.org/)
* [Blue Ridge Adaptive Snow Sports (BRASS)](https://www.brasski.org/)
* [Maine Adaptive Sports & Recreation (MASR)](https://maineadaptive.org/)
* [National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD)](https://nscd.org/)

Among these organizations, **Maine Adaptive** contacted us and shared a lot of experience and insight with us, which we have learned from to create our prototype solution.

## Learnings from Maine Adaptive

### Inspiration, Origin and History

Maine Adaptive started in 1982. Some founders were disabled, and wanted to experience sports like able-bodied people. Maine Adaptive has collaborated with innovative designers and toolmakers to create assistive equipment for people who have lost limbs, hearing or vision. To this date they have helped over 400 such people.

### Design Process

Maine Adaptive has developed a very comprehensive process for designing equipment to help disabled people. They have come up with personalized approaches for different disabilities, for example:

* **Bi-skis** for people with weak upper bodies
* **Four-tracker skis** for peole with balancing difficulties 
* **Sit-down skis** for people who can't stand (people that have lost legs or are lower-body paralyzed)
* **Audio assistance** for people with poor eyesight: for example, a bell can be used as a signal to turn, or a headset can connect visually-disabled skier with a guide who can tell when to turn or when to slow down to avoid obstacles
* **Special tethers** on the sides of the slopes to prevent disabled/blind skiers from going off course.

Overall we learned a lot about their design process. It was very inspiring to learn how they customize their designs to give the users an experience that is as close as possible to not having a disablility. However, the designs sometimes take several years to complete and perfect.

## Our Wheelchair-on-Skis Design

Our team has developed a wheelchair that has skis attached to its wheels. This innovation will enable people to move through snowy or icy terrain more easily. However, during the testing phase, we encountered a few issues that needed addressing. For instance, the wheelchair was accelerating too fast, which could be dangerous. Additionally, it was not maintaining enough momentum. We received feedback from Adaptive Sports and learned from it.

We made several modifications to our design. We added brakes on each side of the wheelchair that can be used to steer and stop. We also discovered that we could use the brakes to push ourselves forward, which enabled us to maintain a more consistent and controlled speed. We're excited about these changes, and we believe that our design will be of great benefit to people with disabilities who wish to ski. We are currently using a 3D printer to print our model and test it.

## Materials / Tech / Production

We learned that Main Adaptive makes everything according to the customer. They measure everything, check weight, and make all the measurements needed for the product to fit the customer. They use aluminum because it's strong and doesn't break easily, and because it's super light. They also use titanium because it's light. These two materials are key for making sure the whole product doesn't break apart, and they are very useful at attachment points.

They don't use much in the way of electronics, except for some gear and headwear. Most stuff is powered by gears, or in some cases, physically.  They said that there has been a major improvement in technology. In one case, the user would blow into a straw, and that would start up the skis/chair, so that the user would not have to do much.
