Innovation is one of the six Core Values that get evaluated.

## Innovation

Innovation means we use creativity and persistance to solve our problems. A problem may occur at the most unexpected time, and it can be bad for teams without innovation.

## Innovation's Tale

One time during our robot game match, our robot's hub ran out of battery, but luckily we had an hour to make repairs and use innovation.
We replaced some stuff, checked it worked, and innovation had saved our robot match. Using persistance and creativity, we made our robot work again.
