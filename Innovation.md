Innovation is one of the six Core Values of FLL, and we have got an awesome opportunity to research about and design solutions for this season's Innovation Project. This project challenges us to use technology to enable more people to enjoy rewarding hobbies. We have decided to focus on **helping disabled people ski**.

## Outreach to Disabled Sports Innovators

We wanted to learn from the best, so we have contacted 6 different disabled sports organizations across the US, which are:

* [Adaptive Sports Center, Colorado](https://www.adaptivesports.org/) 
* [Adaptive Sports  Connection, Ohio](https://adaptivesportsconnection.org/)
* [American Blind Skiing Foundation (ABSF)](https://www.absf.org/)
* [Blue Ridge Adaptive Snow Sports (BRASS)](https://www.brasski.org/)
* [Maine Adaptive Sports & Recreation (MASR)](https://maineadaptive.org/)
* [National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD)](https://nscd.org/)

Among these organizations, **Maine Adaptive** contacted us and shared with us a lot of experience and insight, which we have learned from to create our prototype solution.

## Learnings from Maine Adaptive

### Inspiration, Origin and History

Maine Adaptive started in 1982. Some founders were disabled, and wanted to experience sports like able-bodied people. Maine Adaptive has collaborated with innovative designers and toolmakers to created assistive equipment for people who have lost limbs, hearing or vision. To date they have helped over 400 such people.

### Design Process
   

My team and I had an interview with Adaptive Sports for our innovation project. For our innovation project, we are trying to help
disabled skiers ski more efficient, safer and have a more enjoyable experience.

We learned that Adaptive Sports personalize solutions for different kinds of disabilities. They focus their designs to ensure 
that people with disabilities have as close an experience skiing like they don't have a disablity. For people in 
wheelchairs, if someone can't stand they use mono skis and if they have lower upper body strength, they use bi skis. 
If they have trouble balancing they use four tracker skis. 

For people that have poor eyesight they had several design ideas. For example they use a bell as a signal to turn. Another example is  
using a headset to communicate with a skier to help guide them to turn/slow down to avoid obstacles or slow down if going to fast. 
Finaly, part of the Adaptive Sports design was to use tethers on the side of slopes so the disabled/blind skier can't go off course.

Overall we learned a lot about their designs/design process. It was very inspiring to learn how they customized their designs to be as 
close as possible to the experience without a disability even though the designs somtimes took several years to complete.
