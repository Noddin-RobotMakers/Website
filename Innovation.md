Innovation is one of the six Core Values of FLL, and we have got an awesome opportunity to research about and design solutions for this season's Innovation Project. This project challenges us to use technology to enable more people to enjoy rewarding hobbies. We have decided to focus on **helping disabled people ski** with efficiency and safety.

## Outreach to Disabled Sports Innovators

We wanted to learn from the best, so we have reached out and e-mailed 6 different disabled sports organizations across the US, which are:

* [Adaptive Sports Center, Colorado](https://www.adaptivesports.org/) 
* [Adaptive Sports Connection, Ohio](https://adaptivesportsconnection.org/)
* [American Blind Skiing Foundation (ABSF)](https://www.absf.org/)
* [Blue Ridge Adaptive Snow Sports (BRASS)](https://www.brasski.org/)
* [Maine Adaptive Sports & Recreation (MASR)](https://maineadaptive.org/)
* [National Sports Center for the Disabled (NSCD)](https://nscd.org/)

Among these organizations, **Maine Adaptive** contacted us and shared a lot of experience and insight with us. We have learned from them to create our prototype solution.

## Learnings from Maine Adaptive

### Inspiration, Origin and History

![Maine Adaptive](https://maineadaptive.org/) started in 1982. Some founders were disabled, and wanted to experience sports like able-bodied people. Maine Adaptive has collaborated with innovative designers and toolmakers to create assistive equipment for people who have lost limbs, hearing or vision. To this date they have helped over 400 such people.

### Design Process

Maine Adaptive has developed a very comprehensive process for designing equipment to help disabled people. They have come up with personalized approaches for different disabilities, for example:

* **Bi-skis** for people with weak upper bodies
* **Four-tracker skis** for people with balancing difficulties 
* **Sit-down skis** for people who can't stand (people that have lost legs or are lower-body paralyzed)
* **Audio assistance** for people with poor eyesight: for example, a bell can be used as a signal to turn, or a headset can connect visually-disabled skier with a guide who can tell when to turn or when to slow down to avoid obstacles
* **Special tethers** on the sides of the slopes to prevent disabled/blind skiers from going off course.

Overall we learned a lot about their design process. It was very inspiring to learn how they customize their designs to give the users an experience that is as close as possible to not having a disablility. 

### Materials / Tech / Production

#### Materials/Production
* We learned that Main Adaptive makes everything according to the customer. 
* Main Adaptive has everything measured, weight checked, and makes sure all the measurements needed for the product to fit the customer. 
* They use aluminum because it's strong and doesn't break easily, and because it's super light.
* They also use titanium because it's light.
* However, the designs sometimes take several years to complete and perfect.
These two materials are key for making sure the whole product doesn't break apart, and they are very useful at attachment points.

#### Tech
* They don't use much in the way of electronics, except for some gear and headwear. 
* Most stuff is powered by gears, or in some cases, physically. 
* They said that there has been a major improvement in technology. In one case, the user would blow into a straw, and that would start up the skis/chair, where the blowing acts like a trigger button for people with limited movement.


## Our Innovation: The *SkiChair 2.0*
![Our Wheelchair ski designs](Media/Images/Innovation-Project-Interview/Wheelchair-Ski-Design-Presentation.jpg)

Our team is developing a wheelchair that has skis attached to its wheels, and we call it the _SkiChair_ _2.0_. It's 2.0 because we are in our 2nd design generation.
The _SkiChair_ _2.0_ offers the following benefits:
* **Comfortable and Convenient**: The _SkiChair_ _2.0_ helps people with disabilities have a comfortable skiing experience, and is convenient to get into and out of.
* **Fitting and Inclusive**: The _SkiChair_ _2.0_ is made to fit diverse people with special needs.
* **Easy and Safe**:The _SkiChair_ _2.0_ enables people to move through snowy or icy terrain in an easier way, without slipping.

### Design modifications
Through two design itterations we have made several modifications to our design. 
* We added brakes on each side of the wheelchair that can be used to steer and stop. 
* We also discovered that we could use the brakes to push ourselves forward, which enabled us to maintain a more consistent and controlled speed.
We're excited about these changes, and we believe that our design will be of great benefit to people with disabilities who wish to ski. 

### Prototyping and testing
However, during the testing phase, we encountered a few issues that needed addressing. We received feedback from Maine Adaptive and learned from it.
* The wheelchair was accelerating too fast, which could be dangerous. 
* Additionally, it was not maintaining enough momentum.
* We have used a 3D printer to print our model and test it.
