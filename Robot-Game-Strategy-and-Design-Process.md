# Our Robot Game Strategy and Design Process

When it comes to this 2023-2024 FLL Challenge season's Robot Game, there are many missions to complete. However, not all 15 missions are worth spending time on. To make the most of the __2.5-minute time limit__, we need to carefully consider which missions are worth doing and which ones aren't.

## Strategy

To do this, we need to come up with a __strategy__. One approach we can take is to think and create a __route__ that allows us to efficiently complete as many missions as possible. By doing this, we can prioritize the most important missions and avoid wasting time on ones that don't contribute much to our overall score.

## Base Bot

Once we have a strategy in place, the next step is to __design our Base Bot__. It's important to make our Base Bot __small and sturdy__ so that it can move around the field easily and withstand any collisions or obstacles.

## Attachments

In addition to our base bot, we also need to __design attachments__ that will help us complete specific challenges. When designing these attachments, we need to make sure that they are based on the movement we need to complete the mission. We also consider if the attachment needs __active attachment motor power__ or it just needs to be __passively driven__ by the Base. This means that we need to carefully consider the requirements of each mission and design our attachments accordingly.

## Testing and Iterating

After we have designed our attachments, the next step is __testing__. We need to use our bot and turn the gears to see if the attachment works as intended. If it does, we can move on to the next attachment. However, if the attachment doesn't work, we need to __re-design__ it until it does the specific mission.

By following these steps, we can maximize our score within the time limit and complete as many missions as possible.
Our strategy for the game was to choose some missions that were easy and quick. Then we made attachments for those missions.
