# What Are _FIRST_ Core Values?

Through _FIRST_ Lego League (FLL), we have learned much more than just robotics. We have learned respecting teammates and others in the community, discovering things and tools we had not known before, solving problems with creativity and perseverance, sharing our knowledge and creations with others, valuing each other's ideas and contributions, and having fun through the challenges.

## Teamwork

No one team member can do the whole Innovation Project or robot game by herself or himself, so we have to collaborate and support each other. We the Robotmakers have worked together for __40 meetings__ or __150 hours__ this season!

We have helped each other fix many problems. For example, during the Qualifier, __our robot hub broke down very seriously, and Ryan contributed his backup hub and the whole team worked together to rebuild the robot completely inside-out in just 20 minutes__!

## Discovery

We love picking up new knowledge and skills, and have learned to use [__near 20 tech tools__](Tools-We-Have-Learned) well to aid our collaborative work. We have also become more knowledgeable about science and engineering.

Some of our favorite learnings are: [programming with Python](Python-Programming-with-Pybricks), [using GitHub for collaboration and making this website](Collaborative-Coding-and-Website-Building-with-GitHub), and designing and testing many LEGO attachment mechanisms.

## Innovation

FLL teams use creativity and critical thinking to solve problems, often leading to great solutions. Our innovation project is about helping blind people or disabled people ski, and we made a design called the
SkiChair 2.0. We started by researching and contacting organizations and sending emails to the top five. After an interview and feedback, we improved the model and 3D printed it.

## Impact

We make a positive difference in their communities and the world by doing our Innovation Project. We want to make an impact in the world with our model and hope that it will change the lives of some disabled people. Additionally, we want to help out other FLL teams by [sharing all our Pybricks](https://github.com/Noddin-RobotMakers/RobotMakers-FLLChallenge-Masterpiece/) and [website code](https://github.com/Noddin-RobotMakers/Website) so they can also learn Python and perhaps Github.

## Inclusion

Every member's ideas and abilities are valued, and we respect everyone. We know each team member's strengths and split up the work so everybody gets a task that they like. We have a lot of work, and sometimes our youngest team member, Ariana(who is in 2nd grade) does it. We help her with things she doesn't know and she is a great help to our team.

## Fun

But most importantly, We believe that learning and teamwork should be happy experiences. Celebrating achievements and enjoying the season is part of the journey. The way we represent fun is that sometimes, rare things happen and we always take pictures of them and save them for laughs. We also sometimes have [pizza together](Gallery) on occasions like qualifying to Regionals.

In the end, FLL is about more than robots. It's about innovating, teamwork, and having fun, equipped with the skills and values they need to make the world a better place.
