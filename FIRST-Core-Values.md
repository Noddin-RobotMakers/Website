# What Are _FIRST_ Core Values?

Through _FIRST_ Lego League (FLL), we have learned much more than just robotics. We have learned respecting teammates and others in the community, discovering things and tools we had not known before, solving problems with creativity and perseverance, sharing our knowledge and creations with others, valuing each other's ideas and contributions, and having fun through the challenges.

## Teamwork

No one team member can do the whole Innovation Project or robot game by herself or himself, so we have to collaborate and support each other. We the Robotmakers have worked together for __40 meetings__ or __150 hours__ this season!

We have helped each other fix many problems. For example, during the Qualifier, __our robot hub broke down very seriously, and Ryan contributed his backup hub and the whole team worked together to rebuild the robot completely inside-out in just 20 minutes__!

## Discovery

We love picking up new knowledge and skills, and have learned to use [__near 20 tech tools__](Tools-We-Have-Learned) well to aid our collaborative work. We have also become more knowledgeable about science and engineering.

Some of our favorite learnings are: [__programming with Python__](Python-Programming-with-Pybricks), [__using GitHub for collaboration and making this website__](Collaborative-Coding-and-Website-Building-with-GitHub), and designing and testing many LEGO attachment mechanisms.

## Innovation

We have really enjoyed doing our [Innovation Project](Innovation-Project), which focuses on researching how to __make skiing easier for disabled people__. We have learned that disabled athletes have great perseverance, and that some creative problem-solvers have come up with innovative sport equipment for disabled people.

We have learned from experts in adaptive sports, especially from [Maine Adaptive Sports & Recreation](https://maineadaptive.org), who has given us detailed advice and feedback, which has helped us make a good 3D prototype.

## Impact

We can make a positive difference to the community by our creative ideas such as through our Innovation Project, which aims to help disabled people enjoy skiing.

Additionally, we are [__sharing all of our Pybricks code__](https://github.com/Noddin-RobotMakers/RobotMakers-FLLChallenge-Masterpiece) and [__our website code__](https://github.com/Noddin-RobotMakers/Website) openly, so that other and future FLL teams could benefit from what we have learned.

## Inclusion

We have learned to value each other's ideas and hard work, even though we don't always agree. We know each team member's strengths and split up the work so everybody gets a task that he or she can do well at for our team.

Even our __youngest team member Ariana, who is in 2nd grade, has been assigned to do a lot of important work__. For example, __she has done the most in building this website, with the help of the rest of us__, who originally knew more than she did about certain skills and tools.

## Fun

We have been very happy with our learning journey and had many nice memories with each other this season!
