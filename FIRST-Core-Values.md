# What Are FLL Core Values?

The FIRST Lego League (FLL) is more than a robotics competition; it's a program that helps young minds develop critical skills for the future. Central to its philosophy are the Core Values, principles that guide teams not only in how they approach challenges but also in how they work together and impact their communities. These values are designed to foster respect, collaboration, and a love for learning and innovation.

## The Core Values

- **Teamwork**: Collaboration is key. FLL emphasizes the strength found in working together, encouraging teams to support each other and share their unique skills.

- **Discovery**: Participants are encouraged to explore new skills and ideas, driving innovation and creative problem-solving.

- **Innovation**: FLL teams use creativity and critical thinking to solve problems, often leading to novel solutions and advancements.

- **Impact**: Applying what they learn, teams aim to make a positive difference in their communities and the world.

- **Inclusion**: Every member's ideas and abilities are valued, creating a welcoming environment where diversity is celebrated.

- **Fun**: Perhaps most importantly, FLL believes that learning and teamwork should be joyful experiences. Celebrating achievements and enjoying the process are essential parts of the journey.

## Why Are These Values Important?

The FLL Core Values go beyond the competition; they prepare participants for future challenges and opportunities. By embracing these principles, teams learn not just how to build robots, but how to build character, foster teamwork, and make meaningful contributions to society. These values lay the foundation for a positive, inclusive, and impactful experience, ensuring that every participant comes away with valuable life lessons.

In the end, FLL is about more than robots. It's about nurturing the next generation of innovators, leaders, and problem-solvers, equipped with the skills and values they need to make the world a better place.

# How We Embody the _FIRST_ Core Values

## Embracing Impact

In our journey through the FIRST Lego League (FLL), we've learned to harness our knowledge and skills to make a tangible impact on the world. Our commitment to applying what we've learned extends beyond the competition; it's about contributing to our community and beyond, sparking curiosity and innovation.

### Making a Difference

Our innovation project stands as a testament to our dedication to impact. By focusing on solutions that assist disabled individuals in skiing, we've not only tackled a significant challenge but have also opened doors for new possibilities, making sports more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.

### Examples of Our Impact

- **Innovation for Accessibility**: Our research and development efforts aim to empower disabled individuals, allowing them to experience the thrill of skiing without the constraints of their disabilities. This initiative reflects our belief in creating solutions that cater to everyone, enhancing inclusivity in sports and leisure activities.

## Celebrating Fun

Amidst the complexities of robotics, we've discovered the importance of fun. It's the glue that binds us together, helping us navigate challenges with a positive spirit. Our approach to FLL is infused with joy, celebrating successes, learning from failures, and cherishing every moment of our journey.

### Moments of Joy

- **Pizza Parties**: Sharing meals, particularly pizza, has become a cherished tradition for us, especially during long sessions. These moments aren't just about enjoying delicious food; they're opportunities for us to bond, reflect on our progress, and re-energize for the tasks ahead.

- **High Scores and Happy Accidents**: Achieving high scores in robot games is always a cause for celebration. But equally memorable are the mix-ups and unexpected outcomes that sometimes occur. These instances teach us resilience and remind us that perfection is not the goalâ€”perseverance and teamwork are.

### Why Fun Matters

For us, fun is not just a break from work; it's an integral part of our creative and problem-solving processes. It fosters a positive atmosphere that encourages experimentation and innovation. Our shared laughter and joyous celebrations make our FLL experience uniquely rewarding and memorable.

## Discovery

Discovery means that we explore new ideas. If a team doesn't discover and explore new ideas, they might end up with one attachment for the whole game. That will limit their options, and on top of that, their chance of winning the game. Without discovery lots of inventions would not be around today. Inventors need to discover new ideas.

### Discovery's Tale

We were really stuck on an attachment for Mission 1. We explored and tried, discovering new ideas and many ways to do the mission, until we discovered an attachment that hasn't failed us in quite a while.
