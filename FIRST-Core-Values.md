# _FIRST_ Core Values

## Impact

* We apply what we learned and use it to improve the world. Our information is useful and can help us or the world learn and wonder about new things.
* One example we impact the world is our research for the Innovation Project. The research we did will improve the world for us and other people by giving us new solutionsfor our problems. We will solve many problems with our innovations and ideas.

* An example of impact is for our innovation project we can impact disabled people by allowing them to ski without any worries or problems about their disabilities.

## Fun

### We've Had Tons of Fun

Robotics is very hard, so we have learned to have fun to overcome the challenges together.

We are positive and celebrate both sucesses and failures.
 Our funny stories and memories are all shared by different team members.
FLL is fun and we all have fun working together. Fun is important in this team.

Some fun things that happened were eating pizza together, high scores in the robot games, and some mission mix-ups.

### Pizza Parties

We ate pizza pretty commonly, mostly when sessions ran over lunchtime or dinnertime.
This was also a good time for us to review our progress and what we needed to work on.
The pizza also helped us regain some energy after long hours of work and testing.

### High Robot game scores

High scores in our robot game were pure practice.
It was fun when we had to change the code and then## Core Values

Remember these six Core Values: Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork, and Fun. As a team, it is essential to demonstrate these values during the competition. Here's what each Core Value means:

Teamwork: We are stronger when we work together. For instance, we offer each other assistance with coding, building, and researching.

Discovery: We explore new skills and ideas together, such as using devices on the computer.

Innovation: We use creativity and persistence to solve problems. We build robotics to solve problems like coding the robot.

Impact: We apply what we learn to improve the world. We learn together to help the world with our ideas.

Inclusion: We respect each other's ideas for innovation projects and embrace our differences.

Fun: We enjoy and celebrate what we do! We had a great time together coding, building, and working on the innovation project.
