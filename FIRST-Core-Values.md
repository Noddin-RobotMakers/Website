# What Are FLL Core Values?

At FIRST Lego League (FLL), we learn much more than just robotics. This program is designed to help us develop critical skills that will be useful in the future. The Core Values that guide our approach to challenges, teamwork, and community impact are at the center of the FLL program. These values promote respect, collaboration, a passion for learning, and innovation. We learn how to work together, think creatively, solve problems, and communicate effectively, all while having fun and making a positive impact on our communities.

## Teamwork

 In FLL,  we are stronger when we work together. No teammate can do the whole Innovation Project or the Robot Game by themselves. We help and support each other no matter what. A few ways we use teamwork is that we have worked together on robot games, design, Innovation Projects, and much more for 40 meetings or 120 hours! We have helped each other fix problems: For example, in the qualifier, the bot broke down, but Ryan gave us his hub and the robot started working again.

## Discovery

The discovery means that we explore new skills and ideas. In FLL, we learn many new tools, skills, and many other important skills. We have learned over [20 tools](Tools-We-Have-Learned) and also many new science and engineering skills. Some of our favorite skills we have learned are: making a website, using Github and Python, and also designing different Lego mechanisms.

## Innovation

FLL teams use creativity and critical thinking to solve problems, often leading to great solutions. Our innovation project is about helping blind people or disabled people ski, and we made a design called the
SkiChair 2.0. We started by researching and contacting organizations and sending emails to the top five. After an interview and feedback, we improved the model and 3D printed it.

## Impact

We make a positive difference in their communities and the world by doing our Innovation Project. We want to make an impact in the world with our model and hope that it will change the lives of some disabled people. Additionally, we want to help out other FLL teams by [sharing all our Pybricks](https://github.com/Noddin-RobotMakers/RobotMakers-FLLChallenge-Masterpiece/) and [website code](https://github.com/Noddin-RobotMakers/Website) so they can also learn Python and perhaps Github.

## Inclusion

Every member's ideas and abilities are valued, and we respect everyone. We know each team member's strengths and split up the work so everybody gets a task that they like. We have a lot of work, and sometimes our youngest team member, Ariana(who is in 2nd grade) does it. We help her with things she doesn't know and she is a great help to our team.

## Fun

But most importantly, We believe that learning and teamwork should be happy experiences. Celebrating achievements and enjoying the season is part of the journey. The way we represent fun is that sometimes, rare things happen and we always take pictures of them and save them for laughs. We also sometimes have [pizza together](Gallery) on occasions like qualifying to Regionals.

In the end, FLL is about more than robots. It's about innovating, teamwork, and having fun, equipped with the skills and values they need to make the world a better place.
