# _FIRST_ Core Values

## Impact

* We apply what we learned and use it to improve the world. Our information is useful and can help us or the world learn and wonder about new things.
* One example we impact the world is our research for the Innovation Project. The research we did will improve the world for us and other people by giving us new solutionsfor our problems. We will solve many problems with our innovations and ideas.

* An example of impact is for our innovation project we can impact disabled people by allowing them to ski without any worries or problems about their disabilities.

## Fun

### We've Had Tons of Fun

Robotics is very hard, so we have learned to have fun to overcome the challenges together.

We are positive and celebrate both sucesses and failures.
 Our funny stories and memories are all shared by different team members.
FLL is fun and we all have fun working together. Fun is important in this team.

Some fun things that happened were eating pizza together, high scores in the robot games, and some mission mix-ups.

### Pizza Parties

We ate pizza pretty commonly, mostly when sessions ran over lunchtime or dinnertime.
This was also a good time for us to review our progress and what we needed to work on.
The pizza also helped us regain some energy after long hours of work and testing.

### High Robot game scores

High scores in our robot game were pure practice.
It was fun when we had to change the code and then we got a better score.
Our tests were fun even if we failed. We kept trying till we got it right.

### Mission Mix-Up

What might have been the most fun thing might have been a mission mix-up.
An axle on the robot kept on getting stuck in a hole in the mission. It seemed to be a one-in-a-million chance. But it happened over and over again.
Finally, we put a stub nose on the end of the axle to prevent the mix-up from happening.

And those are three of the most fun things that happened to us

### Other Fun

* An example of the fun that we had was when the axle on the robot kept getting stuck into a hole in the mission. It was a lot of fun to see the rare event happen over and over again.

* An example of fun is also when we got to have pizza as a team. It was a good time to discuss and talk about things we need to improve or that we did good at.

## Inclusion

* Inclusion means that we include everybody and let everyone do a job, such as one person being the coder and one the builder.
* We allow anyone to be a part of the team.
* We respect everyone's opinions, ideas, and differences.

### An Example

* If one person is not doing a job, and is left out, this means that the other team members must use inclusion and let the left out person have a job.
* Inclusion is especially strong if the team also uses teamwork alongside inclusion, and everybody can help tackle a difficult problem.

## Teamwork

* Teamwork means that we are better and stronger as a team. We work together and overcome challenges with each other. We combine each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas.

* We listen to each other and all play a role in the team. Our teamwork pays off as we continue. Without each other, we would have a hard time working.

* One example is when we needed to change the hub out at a competition, Ryan gave us the hub, while Antoni took off the old hub. Aidan took off the pins and helped Antoni put the new hub for the robot. Ariana and Anika helped the boys finish off the new bot. Our teamwork lets us finish off tasks quickly.
