Discovery is one of the six Core Values that a team gets evaluated on.

## Discovery 

Discovery means that we explore new ideas. If a team doesn't discover and explore new ideas, they might end up with one attachment for the whole game. That will limit their options, and on top of that, their chance of winning the game. Without discovery lots of inventions would not be around today. Inventors need to discover new ideas.

## Discovery's Tale

We were really stuck on an attachment for Mission 1. We explored and tried, discovering new ideas and many ways to do the mission, until we discovered an attachment that hasn't failed us in quite a while.
