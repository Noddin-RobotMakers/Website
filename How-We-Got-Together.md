# How We've Got Together

## Good Friends at Noddin
We have known each other for many years at Noddin Elementary School, for example:
* **Aidan** and **Ryan** have been in the same class since 1st grade (2020-2021), 
* **Anika** has known Aidan and Ryan since 2nd grade (2021-2022),
* **Antoni** has known the three of us since 3rd grade (2022-2023), and
* **Ariana**, who is Antoni's younger sister, has known us since 2023 when she entered 1st grade.

## Passion for Robotics

* We all liked and wondered about robotics so we got together to form this team.   
* Our skills contribute to the team so we will continue reaching higher goals and challenges.
