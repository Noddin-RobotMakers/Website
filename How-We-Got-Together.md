We got together in a variety of ways:

## Friendships of Friendships

* We all go to the same school, Noddin Elementary.
* Ryan and Aidan have been in the same class for 4 grades in a row.  
* Anika has been with Aidan and Ryan since second grade.
* Antoni, Ryan, Aidan, and Anika were in the same class for third grade.
* But Aidan and Ryan met Antoni because he was a friend of Aidan and Ryan's friend.

## Passion for Robotics

* We all liked and wondered about robotics so we got together to form this team.   
* Our skills contribute to the team so we will continue reaching higher goals and challenges.
