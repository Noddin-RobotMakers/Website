We got together in a variety of ways:

## Passion for Robotics

We all liked and wondered about robotics so we got together to form this team. Our skills contribute to the team so we will continue reaching higher goals and challenges. 

## Friends

We also are all from the same school, Noddin. Our friendship is one of the reasons we got together and are working as a strong and great team.
