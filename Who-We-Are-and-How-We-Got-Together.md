# How We've Got Together

## Good Friends at Noddin

We have known each other for many years at Noddin Elementary School, for example:

- **Aidan** and **Ryan** have been in the same class since 1st grade (2020-2021),
- **Anika** has known Aidan and Ryan since 2nd grade (2021-2022),
- **Antoni** has known the three of us since 3rd grade (2022-2023), and
- **Ariana**, who is Antoni's younger sister, has known us since 2023 when she entered 1st grade.

## Passion for Robotics

We all liked and wondered about Robotics so we got together to form this team.

- Anika has got inspiration and coaching from her brother, and got inspised to do FLL
- Aidan has loved coding and building, ever since he got a robotics set.
- Antoni and Ariana have been doing FLL Explore for 2 years already.

Our skills contribute to the team so we will continue reaching higher goals and challenges.
