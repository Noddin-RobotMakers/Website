## Passion for Robotics

We all liked and wondered about Robotics so we got together to form this team.

- Anika has got inspiration and coaching from her brother, and got inspised to do FLL
- Aidan has loved coding and building, ever since he got a robotics set.
- Antoni and Ariana have been doing FLL Explore for 2 years already.

Our skills contribute to the team so we will continue reaching higher goals and challenges.
