# Hello from Noddin Robotmakers!

Hi there! We're a team of five students from Noddin Elementary School (San Jose, California) called the Robotmakers,
participating in the 2023-2024 FIRST LEGO League (FLL) robotics competition.  Our team consists of Anika, Aidan, Ryan, Antoni, and Ariana.  As of March 2024, we are in the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Championship after finishing well in the [qualifier](https://youtu.be/gz8UgMTxCSI) in December.

Within this site, you'll find pages that talk about who we are, our robotics learning journey, our strategies and design process, our programming methods,  our collaboration tools, our Innovation Project, a gallery with our pictures, and more! Below you will find interesting highlights.

## Coding Our Bot with Pybricks(Python)

We use [Pybricks](Python-Programming-with-Pybricks), the best open-source Python library for LEGO robotics. Pybricks is useful because it is precise and easy to read for all team members. Pybricks also supports us with a few advanced functionalities for running multiple programs and using special drive base control.

## Innovation project

For our [Innovation Project](Innovation-Project), we focus on researching skiing because our team loves it and would like to help disabled people enjoy skiing too. We've come up with a design named SkiChair 2.0 that lets you sit down and still ski. We started by researching how we could assist individuals with disabilities in skiing, then reached out to organizations and experts for insights and feedback. After expert feedback from [Maine Adaptive Sports & Recreation](https://maineadaptive.org/), we have improved our design and 3D-printed our prototype.

## Collaboration and Website Building on Github

We have created and managed our own [Github](Collaborative-Coding-and-Website-Building-with-GitHub) organization. We used Github to help collaborate when we weren't when each other. It was helpful because other people could double-check for mistakes and make more improvements on what you have written or changed.

We have also used Github Pages to make the website you are on right now! Hope you enjoy your time here. Feel free to browse other pages on the sidebar.
