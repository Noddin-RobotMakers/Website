## Introduction

Hi there! We are a team of five students from Noddin Elementary School participating in a robotics competition called FLL (First Lego League). Our team name is RobotMakers, and our names are Anika, Aidan, Ryan, Antoni, and Ariana. For those who are not familiar with FLL, it is a robotics competition and we code the robots we build to do certain tasks. We use Pybricks Beta, a Python coding software. We keep the code for the robot to perform various missions in this repository. 
## Innovation

Our innovation project is worth 25 percent of our overall score. This project aims to assist blind or disabled people in skiing. We have developed ski goggles equipped with sensors that provide directions like "Go left" or "Go right". The goggles also alert the user of any potential danger, including cliffs or steep drops. We have created slides explaining how we conducted the project, which you can find via this link. Our process began with researching organizations and then reaching out to the top five websites via email. Finally, we constructed prototypes to aid people with disabilities. Our innovation will help improve and help the world.

## Core Values

Remember these six Core Values: Discovery, Innovation, Impact, Inclusion, Teamwork, and Fun. As a team, it is essential to demonstrate these values during the competition. Here's what each Core Value means:

Teamwork: We are stronger when we work together. For instance, we offer each other assistance with coding, building, and researching.

Discovery: We explore new skills and ideas together, such as using devices on the computer.

Innovation: We use creativity and persistence to solve problems. We build robotics to solve problems like coding the robot.

Impact: We apply what we learn to improve the world. We learn together to help the world with our ideas.

Inclusion: We respect each other's ideas for innovation projects and embrace our differences.

Fun: We enjoy and celebrate what we do! We had a great time together coding, building, and working on the innovation project.
