# Hello from Noddin Robotmakers!

## Introduction

Hello! We're a team of five students from Noddin Elementary School called the Robotmakers,
participating in the First Lego League (FLL) robotics competition. Our team consists of Anika, Aidan, Ryan, Antoni, and Ariana. FLL challenges us to build and code robots using Pybricks Beta, a Python-based software,
to complete various missions. This repository not only houses our code but also serves as a gateway
to the various aspects of our project and team dynamics.

Within this site, you'll find pages that delve into who we are, our journey, the core values that guide us,
our strategies for the robot game, our programming adventures, collaborative efforts, innovation projects,
the tools that have empowered us, and a gallery showcasing our experiences.

## Innovation Project: Ski Goggles for the Visually Impaired

Our innovation project, which is a significant part of our FLL score,
focuses on making skiing more accessible for the blind or visually impaired.
Weâ€™ve conceptualized ski goggles integrated with sensors that guide the user with audio cues like "Go left" or "Go right"
and warn them of potential hazards such as cliffs or steep drops.

### How We Developed Our Project

- **Research**: We started by exploring how we could assist individuals with disabilities in skiing. 
Our investigation led us to the idea of smart ski goggles.

- **Outreach**: We contacted organizations and experts through the top five websites we found,
seeking insights and feedback.

- **Prototyping**: With the information gathered, we built prototypes of the ski goggles
designed to aid visually impaired skiers.

This project not only challenges us to think innovatively but also offers a chance to contribute positively to the world.
