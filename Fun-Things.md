Some fun things that happened were eating pizza together, high scores in the robot games, and some mission mix-ups.

## Pizza Parties

We ate pizza pretty commonly, mostly when sessions ran over lunchtime or dinnertime. 
This was also a good time for us to review our progress and what we needed to work on.

## High Robot game scores

High scores in our robot game were pure practice. 
It was fun when we had to change code and then we got a better score.

## Mission Mix-Up

What might have been the most fun thing might have been a mission mix-up. 
An axle on the robot kept on getting stuck in a hole in the mission. It semmed to be a one-in-a-million chance. But it happened over and over again. 
Finally, we put a stub nose on the end of the axle to prevent the mix-up from happening.

And those are three of the most fun things that happened to us.
