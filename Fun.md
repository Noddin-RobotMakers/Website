Some fun things that happened were eating pizza together, high scores in the robot games, and some mission mix-ups.

## Pizza Parties

We ate pizza pretty commonly, mostly when sessions ran over lunchtime or dinnertime. 
This was also a good time for us to review our progress and what we needed to work on. 
The pizza also helped us regain some energy after long hours of work and testing.

## High Robot game scores

High scores in our robot game were pure practice. 
It was fun when we had to change the code and then we got a better score. 
Our tests were fun even if we failed. We kept trying till we got it right. 



## Mission Mix-Up

What might have been the most fun thing might have been a mission mix-up. 
An axle on the robot kept on getting stuck in a hole in the mission. It seemed to be a one-in-a-million chance. But it happened over and over again.  
Finally, we put a stub nose on the end of the axle to prevent the mix-up from happening.

And those are three of the most fun things that happened to us. 



## Fun

* Fun is enjoying and celebrating our success or even failure. We all are positive and try our best even when things don't work out. 
Our upbeat and joyful attitudes are a way we express fun. Our funny stories and memories are all shared by different team members. 
FLL is fun and we all have fun working together. Fun is important in this team.

* An example of the fun that we had was when the axle on the robot kept getting stuck into a hole in the mission. It was a lot of fun to see the rare event happen over and over again.

* An example of fun is also when we got to have pizza as a team. It was a good time to discuss and talk about things we need to improve or that we did good at.
