## Fun

* Fun is enjoying and celebrating our success or even failure. We all are positive and try our best even when things don't work out. 
Our upbeat and joyful attitudes are a way we express fun. Our funny stories and memories are all shared by different team members. 
FLL is fun and we all have fun working together. Fun is important in this team.

* An example of the fun that we had was when the axle on the robot kept getting stuck into a hole in the mission. It was a lot of fun to see the rare event happen over and over again.

* An example of fun is also when we got to have pizza as a team. It was a good time to discuss and talk about things we need to improve or that we did good at.
