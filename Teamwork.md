# Teamwork

* Teamwork means that we are better and stronger as a team. We work together and overcome challenges with each other. We combine each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas.

* We listen to each other and all play a role in the team. Our teamwork pays off as we continue. Without each other, we would have a hard time working.

* One example is when we needed to change the hub out at a competition, Ryan gave us the hub, while Antoni took off the old hub. Aidan took off the pins and helped Antoni put the new hub for the robot. Ariana and Anika helped the boys finish off the new bot. Our teamwork lets us finish off tasks quickly.
