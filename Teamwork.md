## Teamwork 

Teamwork means that we are better and stronger as a team. We work together and overcome challenges with each other. We combine each other's ideas and come up with new and 
better ideas. We listen to each other and all play a role in the team. Our teamwork pays off as we continue. Without each other, we would have a hard time working.
