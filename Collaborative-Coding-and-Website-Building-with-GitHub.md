# Collaborative Coding Experience: GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree

While working on our robot game, we started having many Python code files for the 14 missions and different strategies. It became difficult to keep track of the files, especially among team members. To organize our code better and help all team members know what changes we have made, we have used GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree.

## GitHub

GitHub is really helpful for keeping all our code in one place. We could all work on it together, even when we don't sit together. We have used an advanced feature called "Pull Requests" to help us review complicated changes and make sure no mistakes are made.

## Visual Studio (VS) Code

Visual Studio Code is great for documenting our code and checking our code. Having the checkers helps us write code faster and much fewer mistakes.

## SourceTree

SourceTree makes it a lot simpler for us to work with Git, with is a difficult tool. It shows visually what changes you have made to your code, and helps you keep track of everything.

## Collaborative Coding for Team Website

Our team recently embarked on a new venture to create a website that encapsulates all of our learning processes and cherished memories. After researching various tools and platforms, we decided to use **GitHub Pages** for its ease of use and integration with our existing workflows.

### Learning Journey with GitHub Pages

Through our journey of building the team website with GitHub Pages, we've gained valuable skills and insights:

- **Jekyll Static Website Tool**: We dove into Jekyll, learning how to leverage this powerful tool to generate static websites directly from our GitHub repository. This knowledge enabled us to structure our website efficiently and dynamically.

- **Proficiency in Markdown, HTML, and CSS**: Our work required a deep dive into Markdown for writing content, HTML for structuring our web pages, and CSS for styling. These skills were crucial in developing a site that is not only functional but also visually appealing.

- **Incorporating Multimedia Elements**: Adding videos and pictures to our pages brought our memories and learning experiences to life. This aspect of web development taught us how to enrich our site's content and engage our audience more effectively.

### Reflections on Our Collaborative Experience

Building our website with GitHub Pages proved to be both an enjoyable and educational endeavor. It was a process that not only brought us closer as a team but also enhanced our technical skills in web development. We eagerly anticipate continuing our collaborative efforts and further developing our website in the future.
