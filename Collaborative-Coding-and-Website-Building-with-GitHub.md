# Collaborative Coding Experience: GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree

While working on our robot game, we started having many Python code files for the 14 missions and different strategies. It became difficult to keep track of the files, especially among team members. To organize our code better and help all team members know what changes we have made, we have used GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree.

## GitHub

GitHub is really helpful for keeping all our code in one place. We could all work on it together, even when we don't sit together. We have used an advanced feature called "Pull Requests" to help us review complicated changes and make sure no mistakes are made.

## Visual Studio (VS) Code

Visual Studio Code is great for documenting our code and checking our code. Having the checkers helps us write code faster and much fewer mistakes.

## SourceTree

SourceTree makes it a lot simpler for us to work with Git, with is a difficult tool. It shows visually what changes you have made to your code, and helps you keep track of everything.

## Collaborative Coding for Team Website

After we finished our robot game project, we decided to work on something new: a website to share all our learning experiences and memories. We chose to use GitHub Pages because it was easy to use and we already knew how to work with GitHub. 

## Tools

While working with GitHub Pages we have learned related tools for website building. We used Markdown to write content on the pages. Jekyll then turns the Markdown files to the web pages. HTML helps us adjust the layout. CSS helps us change the look and feel to make them visually nice. We even figured out how to add videos and pictures to our pages to make them look cool.

Overall, we have had a great time working together on our website. It was cool to be able to use all these different tools to make things easier and learn new things.
