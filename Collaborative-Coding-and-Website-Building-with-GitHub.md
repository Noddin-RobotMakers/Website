# Collaborative Coding Experience: GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree

Our team embarked on a project to develop a robot game, necessitating the management of numerous Python code files across different missions and strategies. To address the complexity and scale of this project, we integrated GitHub, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and SourceTree into our workflow, significantly enhancing our project management and coding practices.

## GitHub: Centralizing Our Code

We selected GitHub as our primary platform for code collaboration, creating a GitHub organization and repository for our project. This setup facilitated contributions from all team members, regardless of their location.

- **Direct Code Editing on GitHub**: Utilized for quick edits and documentation updates directly through GitHub's web interface.
- **Pull Requests**: Employed to systematically manage and review complex changes, ensuring cohesive integration of contributions.

## Visual Studio Code: Streamlining Development

VS Code, with its direct GitHub integration, provided a dynamic development environment, allowing for in-editor code management.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Enhanced coding efficiency with debugging tools, syntax highlighting, and customizable extensions.

## SourceTree: Simplifying Git Operations

SourceTree offered a graphical interface for Git repository management, making version control more accessible to those less familiar with Git's command-line interface.

- **Graphical Version Control**: Facilitated a visual approach to understanding the project's branching and merging activities, aiding in the codebase's management.

The integration of GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree into our workflow not only improved our project's efficiency but also our coding practices and understanding of version control. This combination provided a robust framework for managing our robot game project, demonstrating the value of a well-structured collaborative coding environment.
