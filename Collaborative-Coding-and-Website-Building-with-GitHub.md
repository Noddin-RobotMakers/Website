# Collaborative Coding Experience: GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree

Our team embarked on a project to develop a robot game, necessitating the management of numerous Python code files across different missions and strategies. To address the complexity and scale of this project, we integrated GitHub, Visual Studio Code (VS Code), and SourceTree into our workflow, significantly enhancing our project management and coding practices.

## GitHub: Centralizing Our Code

We selected GitHub as our primary platform for code collaboration, creating a GitHub organization and repository for our project. This setup facilitated contributions from all team members, regardless of their location.

- **Direct Code Editing on GitHub**: Utilized for quick edits and documentation updates directly through GitHub's web interface.
- **Pull Requests**: Employed to systematically manage and review complex changes, ensuring cohesive integration of contributions.

## Visual Studio Code: Streamlining Development

VS Code, with its direct GitHub integration, provided a dynamic development environment, allowing for in-editor code management.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Enhanced coding efficiency with debugging tools, syntax highlighting, and customizable extensions.

## SourceTree: Simplifying Git Operations

SourceTree offered a graphical interface for Git repository management, making version control more accessible to those less familiar with Git's command-line interface.

- **Graphical Version Control**: Facilitated a visual approach to understanding the project's branching and merging activities, aiding in the codebase's management.

The integration of GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and SourceTree into our workflow not only improved our project's efficiency but also our coding practices and understanding of version control. This combination provided a robust framework for managing our robot game project, demonstrating the value of a well-structured collaborative coding environment.

## Collaborative Coding for Team Website

Our team recently embarked on a new venture to create a website that encapsulates all of our learning processes and cherished memories. After researching various tools and platforms, we decided to use **GitHub Pages** for its ease of use and integration with our existing workflows.

### Learning Journey with GitHub Pages

Through our journey of building the team website with GitHub Pages, we've gained valuable skills and insights:

- **Jekyll Static Website Tool**: We dove into Jekyll, learning how to leverage this powerful tool to generate static websites directly from our GitHub repository. This knowledge enabled us to structure our website efficiently and dynamically.

- **Proficiency in Markdown, HTML, and CSS**: Our work required a deep dive into Markdown for writing content, HTML for structuring our web pages, and CSS for styling. These skills were crucial in developing a site that is not only functional but also visually appealing.

- **Incorporating Multimedia Elements**: Adding videos and pictures to our pages brought our memories and learning experiences to life. This aspect of web development taught us how to enrich our site's content and engage our audience more effectively.

### Reflections on Our Collaborative Experience

Building our website with GitHub Pages proved to be both an enjoyable and educational endeavor. It was a process that not only brought us closer as a team but also enhanced our technical skills in web development. We eagerly anticipate continuing our collaborative efforts and further developing our website in the future.
