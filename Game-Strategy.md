Our strategy for the game was to chose some missions that were easy and quick. Then we made attachments for the missions. 
## Attachments

We made two types attachments, passive and active. The active attachments needs one or two motors to operate a mission. The passive attachments don't need motors or electronics.
Each attachment had to be efficent and work at least 3-5 times. It took a long time to make them work but it was worth it.

## Missions we completeted

We got the size bonus(All attachments fit in home) which is 20 pts. We also did the 3D Cinema(20 pts), Theater Scene Change(which is 50 points with the bonus), Immersive Experience(20 pts), Masterpiece(30 pts), 
Augmented Reality Statue(30 pts), Hologram Performer(20 pts), Concert lights and sounds(20 pts), Rolling Camera(30 pts), Movie Set(10 pts), Sound Mixer(20 pts), Virtual Reality Artist(30 pts), Craft Creator(30 pts), 
Expert Delivery(10 pts), Audience Delivery(40 pts).

## Testing

We did a lot testing and changed a lot of attachments in the tests. We had a hard time but it was worth it.
