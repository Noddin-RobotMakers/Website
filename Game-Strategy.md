Our strategy for the game was to choose some missions that were easy and quick. Then we made attachments for those missions. 
After that, we moved on to making attachments for harder missions and testing them. 
We learned about different types of attachments, and what attachments are best for which task.

## Attachments

### Types of attachments 

We made two types of attachments, passive and active. 

* Passive attachments don't need motors or electronics. They are very useful because the robot only has two motors for attachments. They are a lot simpler and easier to work with than active attachments.

* Active attachments need one or two motors to operate the attachment. These are helpful when completing a mission that doesn't have a clear path because the attachment can move independently from the robot, unlike passive attachments.

### Attachment Testing

* Each attachment had to be efficent and work at least 5-10 times before we were confident about the attachment working.
 It took a long time to make them work but it was worth it for the points.
 We made sure it worked multiple times so that we wouldn't have any doubts about it not working.

### Attachment Utility

* When we made the plan for the attachments, we carefully considered how to use attachments for more than one purpose.
 This way, we could save time because we didn't have to put on extra attachments, test them, or carry them around.
