Inclusion is one of the six Core Values that the judges evaluate.

## Inclusion

* Inclusion means that we include everybody and let everyone do a job, such as one person being the coder and one the builder.
* We allow anyone to be a part of the team.
* We respect everyone's opinions, ideas, and differences.

## An Example

* If one person is not doing a job, and is left out, this means that the other team members must use inclusion and let the left out person have a job. 
* Inclusion is especially strong if the team also uses teamwork alongside inclusion, and everybody can help tackle a difficult problem.
