# Robot Game Strategy

Our strategy for the game was to choose some missions that were easy and quick. Then we made attachments for those missions.
After that, we moved on to making attachments for harder missions and testing them.
We learned about different types of attachments, and what attachments are best for which task.

## Attachments

### Types of attachments

We made two types of attachments, passive and active.

* Passive attachments don't need motors or electronics. They are very useful because the robot only has two motors for attachments. They are a lot simpler and easier to work with than active attachments.

* Active attachments need one or two motors to operate the attachment. These are helpful when completing a mission that doesn't have a clear path because the attachment can move independently from the robot, unlike passive attachments.

### Attachment Testing

* Each attachment had to be efficient and work at least 5-10 times before we were confident about the attachment working.
 It took a long time to make them work but it was worth it for the points.
 We made sure it worked multiple times so that we wouldn't have any doubts about it not working.

### Attachment Utility

* When we made the plan for the attachments, we carefully considered how to use attachments for more than one purpose.
 This way, we could save time because we didn't have to put on extra attachments, test them, or carry them around.

## Mission strategies

* We chose missions that were close to the home area, and that were on the way to/back from other missions.
* We got the size bonus, which means that all of our attachments and the robot fit in one launch area, which earns us 20 pts.

## Missions we completed

* We also did the 3D Cinema(20 pts)
* Theater Scene Change (which is 50 points with the pink-pink matching bonus)
* Immersive Experience (20 pts)
* Masterpiece (10 pts with the 20 pts bonus)
* Augmented Reality Statue (30 pts)
* Hologram Performer (20 pts)
* Concert lights and sounds (10 pts for each of these)
* Rolling Camera (30 pts)
* Movie Set (10 pts)
* Sound Mixer (2 sliders, 10 pts for each slider)
* Virtual Reality Artist (10 pts, with the 20 pts bonus)
* Craft Creator (10 pts for the lid, and 20 pts for the machine)
* Expert Delivery(20 pts)
* Audience Delivery (55 pts)
* We usually have 50 pts in precision tokens remaining. We can complete 12 missions, and our maximum number of points is 445 pts.

## Testing

* We did a lot of testing and changed how a lot of the attachments worked. The code was also faulty most of the time. We had a hard time but it was worth it.
